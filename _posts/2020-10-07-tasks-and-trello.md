Katie will be joining us today to talk about how Phase 4 and Career Services work together. We'll have time for any questions you want to ask about preparing for the job market after graduation, and how to maximize your work in Phase 4 to set yourself up for success.

## Today's topics

- Finalizing your product idea
- Writing user stories
- Turning user stories into tasks
- Creating your Trello board

## Create tasks on your Trello board today

Your team's trello board has columns predefined to start you off. Please add the tasks you create to the backlog. You may also want a column for user stories that are driving those tasks.

You are welcome to adapt the board to your team's needs and create additional columns to support the way your team works.
