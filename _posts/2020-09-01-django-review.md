Today we're not introducing anything new, but we will test our understanding and assumptions about django and do some live coding in class together. We'll also practice reading errors, debugging, and getting back on track when it feels like you're not making progress.

## Mob Programming Exercise

We're going to live code together in class using a practice called _mob programming_. This is like pair programming, with more than two people but still only one computer. We produce code as a group and everyone participates in figuring out what the code should be.
