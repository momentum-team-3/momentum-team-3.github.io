Welcome to Phase 3, everyone! I wanted to give you some notes this weekend to get ready.

[This is your new classroom URL](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/89773940080?pwd=U0tmaGloZTNQWE1icVJkbUg5cWZQQT09). You'll use this for class throughout Phase 3.

If you are studying front-end development, you will meet with me 9:30-11:30 AM on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday.

If you are studying back-end development, you will meet with me 2:00-4:00 PM on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday.

**This Wednesday, you will still meet, since we have a short week.**

If you are studying front-end, we'll be reviewing JavaScript on Tuesday. You might want to spend some time with [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) this weekend, especially chapters 3-6.

If you are studying back-end, we'll be digging more into the Django ORM on Tuesday. You might want to read [this blog post](https://davit.tech/django-queryset-examples/) this weekend and review [Making queries](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/db/queries/) from the Django documentation.
