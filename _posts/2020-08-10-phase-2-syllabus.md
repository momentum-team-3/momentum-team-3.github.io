title: Phase 2 Syllabus, Part 1
tags: phase-2 python django syllabus
---

As requested, here's a master syllabus for this phase, up to our introduction to Django. I hope to have the Django syllabus up later this week. I will also be releasing separate syllabi for advanced Python topics (many of which I'll likely cover in class as time permits) and very advanced topics (I will likely not cover these in great detail, but I hope they can provide a good roadmap if you plan to study Python further).
