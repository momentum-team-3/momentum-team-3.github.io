title: Python Sequences and Files
tags: phase-2 python sequences lists tuples files

We can use the generic term _sequence_ for any object that provides an ordered structure for a number of items, such as a string (a group of characters), a list, or a dictionary (keys and values).

## Today's topics

- Bread & butter sequence types: `list`, `str`, `tuple`, and `dict`
- Sequence keywords: `for` and `in`
- Working with files

## Tomorrow's topics

- Comprehensions for lists, dicts, and generators
- Important sequence methods

You'll be doing this assignment for the next two days, and we'll work on parts of it in class.
