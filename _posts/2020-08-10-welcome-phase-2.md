### Project

We'll begin Python the way we began JavaScript, with some exercises and tests you can run to keep you on track. We're going to use an awesome free online tool called [Exercism](https://exercism.io/).

Please sign up (you can use your GitHub account) and choose [the Python track](https://exercism.io/tracks/python). There are two ways to use Exercism, in Practice Mode or Mentor Mode. It's up to you which you choose.

Work through the setup instructions to install Exercism on your computer with Homebrew. In the Python track, complete the following exercises:

1. **Hello World**
2. **Raindrops**
3. **Hamming**

For each exercise, follow the instructions on Exercism to upload your solution.

**To submit your homework, paste your solution urls into [this form](https://forms.gle/uZ7nc2A9uwacaDXD6).**

If you get through all three of these, please continue with other exercises that seem fun to you. There are lots to choose from!
